# Enhanced Oil Painting Brushstroke Rendering in Images

This project focuses on enhancing the oil painting brushstroke effect in images using advanced image processing techniques. We provide both a baseline implementation and an improved implementation that incorporates style transfer to achieve more realistic and visually appealing results.

## Project Structure

- `Baseline_version.py`: Contains the baseline implementation of the oil painting brushstroke rendering.
```bash
python Baseline_version.py
```

- `Improved_version.py`: Contains the improved implementation with additional features, including style transfer.
    You could set the apply style transfer flag in main( ) to True to enable the style transfer feature.
```bash
python Improved_version.py
```


## Requirements

To run the project, you need to set up a python env of 3.9.

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
